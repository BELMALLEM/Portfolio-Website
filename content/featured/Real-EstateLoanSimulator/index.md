Can I see all the details concerning a loan before taking it ?

This project is about presenting an interface where a user can interact with to know the interest he would pay after taking the selected loan, how much of time will it take to pay the debt completely, etc. After confirming the loan he selected, the app suggests a date to visit the bank in order to present all related papers and complete the procedure.

This project was a work for the [SG Bank](https://www.sgmaroc.com/)
