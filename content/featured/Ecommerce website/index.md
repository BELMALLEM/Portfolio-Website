This project focuses on developing an interactive eCommerce platform where users securely browse, select, and purchase products. The platform integrates Stripe for seamless payment processing, allowing users to review their payment details, including total costs, applicable taxes, and potential installment options. Additionally, the system uses Auth0 for robust authentication management, ensuring a secure and personalized user experience. 

Upon confirming their purchase, in future the app will add some other features, as suggesting optimal delivery dates based on user preferences and availability, and providing options for users to track their orders and manage their account settings.
